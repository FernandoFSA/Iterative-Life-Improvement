## Step 1: Life Area Assessment (15 minutes)

### Your Mission
Find the life area that needs attention most urgently.

### What To Do

1. **Open Appendix A** and look at all the sub-areas
2. **Rate each sub-area from 1-4**:
   - 1 = Terrible (major problems, very dissatisfied)
   - 2 = Bad (significant issues, often frustrated)  
   - 3 = Good (generally okay, minor issues)
   - 4 = Excellent (very satisfied, no major concerns)

3. **Fill out this scoresheet**:

```
A.1 PERSONAL
□ Self-knowledge: ___
□ Being-in-the-world: ___  
□ Self-development: ___
□ Leisure: ___
Total: ___ ÷ 4 = ___ average

A.2 HEALTH  
□ Physical: ___
□ Mental: ___
□ Spiritual: ___
Total: ___ ÷ 3 = ___ average

A.3 RELATIONSHIPS
□ Family: ___
□ Partner/spouse: ___
□ Friends: ___  
□ Community: ___
Total: ___ ÷ 4 = ___ average

A.4 CAREER
□ Finances: ___
□ Professional development: ___
□ Professional satisfaction: ___
Total: ___ ÷ 3 = ___ average
```

4. **Find your focus area**:
   - Circle the life area with the **lowest average**
   - Within that area, highlight the **lowest individual score**
   - This is your focus sub-area!

### Example
Sarah's scores:
- Personal: 2.5 average
- Health: **1.7 average** ← lowest!
- Relationships: 3.0 average  
- Career: 2.3 average

Within Health: Physical(1), Mental(2), Spiritual(2)
**Focus area: Physical Health**

## Step 2: Problem Assessment (10 minutes)

### Your Mission
Identify the specific problem to solve in your focus area.

### What To Do

1. **Brainstorm problems** in your focus sub-area:
   - What's not working?
   - What frustrates you most?
   - List 3-5 specific problems

2. **Rate each problem**:
   - Effort to fix (1=Very Easy, 2=Easy, 3=Medium, 4=Hard, 5=Very Hard)
   - Impact if solved (1=Very Low, 2=Low, 3=Medium, 4=High, 5=Very High)
   - Calculate: Impact ÷ Effort = Priority score

3. **Use this worksheet**:

```
PROBLEM: ________________________________
Effort: ___ Impact: ___ Priority: ___

PROBLEM: ________________________________  
Effort: ___ Impact: ___ Priority: ___

PROBLEM: ________________________________
Effort: ___ Impact: ___ Priority: ___

PROBLEM: ________________________________
Effort: ___ Impact: ___ Priority: ___

PROBLEM: ________________________________
Effort: ___ Impact: ___ Priority: ___
```

4. **Pick the problem with the highest priority score**

### Example (Physical Health)
- Poor sleep quality: Effort(4) Impact(5) = **1.25 priority**
- No exercise routine: Effort(5) Impact(4) = **0.8 priority**  
- Irregular meals: Effort(2) Impact(4) = **2.0 priority** ← Winner!
- Too much coffee: Effort(2) Impact(2) = **1.0 priority**

**Selected problem: Irregular meals**

---

## Step 3: Solution Assessment (15 minutes)

### Your Mission
Find the best solutions for your chosen problem.

### What To Do

1. **Understand the problem deeply**:
   - What exactly is wrong? _________________________________
   - What would "better" look like? _________________________

2. **Find the root cause** (ask "Why?" 3 times):
   - Why is this happening? _______________________________
   - Why is that happening? _______________________________  
   - Why is that happening? _______________________________

3. **Generate 5 solutions** to address the root cause:

```
SOLUTION: ___________________________________
Effort: ___ Impact: ___ Priority: ___

SOLUTION: ___________________________________
Effort: ___ Impact: ___ Priority: ___

SOLUTION: ___________________________________  
Effort: ___ Impact: ___ Priority: ___

SOLUTION: ___________________________________
Effort: ___ Impact: ___ Priority: ___

SOLUTION: ___________________________________
Effort: ___ Impact: ___ Priority: ___
```

4. **Select using 80/20 rule**:
   - Add up all priority scores: Total = ___
   - Calculate 80%: ___ × 0.8 = ___
   - Pick top solutions that sum to 80% target

### Example (Irregular meals)
**Problem**: I eat at random times, often skip breakfast, rely on snacks
**Better**: Regular meal times, planned nutrition, consistent energy

**Root cause analysis**:
- Why irregular? → No meal planning
- Why no planning? → Don't know what to cook  
- Why don't know? → Never learned meal prep basics

**Solutions**:
- Learn basic meal prep: Effort(3) Impact(4) = **1.33**
- Set meal time alarms: Effort(1) Impact(3) = **3.0**  
- Prep Sunday groceries: Effort(2) Impact(5) = **2.5**
- Cook in batches: Effort(3) Impact(3) = **1.0**
- Use meal planning app: Effort(1) Impact(3) = **3.0**

Total priority: 10.83, 80% = 8.66
**Selected**: Meal alarms(3.0) + App(3.0) + Sunday prep(2.5) = 8.5 ✓

## Step 4: Planning and Execution (5 minutes)

### Your Mission
Turn your solutions into action.

### What To Do

1. **Set your target and deadline**:
   - Target: What specific outcome do you want?
   - Deadline: By when?

2. **Break into tasks**:
   - List specific actions for each solution
   - Identify what resources you need
   - Put in order (what first?)

3. **Create your control system**:
   - How will you measure progress?
   - When will you check progress?

### Example

**Target**: Eat regular, planned meals 6 days/week  
**Deadline**: 4 weeks from today

**Tasks this week**:
1. Download meal planning app (Sunday)
2. Research meal prep basics online (Sunday) 
3. Set 3 daily meal alarms (Sunday)
4. Plan next week's meals (Sunday)
5. Grocery shop with list (Sunday)
6. Prep 3 breakfasts and lunches (Sunday)

**Resources needed**: Phone, $50 grocery budget, 2 hours Sunday

**Progress tracking**: 
- Daily: Did I eat at alarm times? (yes/no)
- Weekly: How many planned meals did I eat? (goal: 18/21)
- Check-in: Every Sunday evening

## Troubleshooting

**"I have tied scores"**: Pick the one that feels most urgent to you right now

**"I can't think of 5 solutions"**: That's okay! Start with 3 and add more later

**"Everything seems important"**: Trust the numbers - they remove emotional bias

**"This feels overwhelming"**: Focus only on your highest-priority solution first

## Success Story Preview

*"After 3 months of PDCA cycles, I went from chaotic eating (irregular meals, constant snacking) to having consistent meal times and feeling more energetic. The systematic approach helped me identify that my real problem wasn't willpower - it was lack of planning skills. Now I naturally meal prep every Sunday."* - Sarah, 28
