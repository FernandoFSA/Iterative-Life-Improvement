*A detailed example showing one complete cycle using the systematic methodology*

---

## PLAN (P)

### 1.1 Life Area Assessment (B.1)

Sarah rated all sub-areas from 1-4:

**A.1 Personal**
- Self-knowledge: 3
- Being-in-the-world: 2  
- Self-development: 2
- Leisure: 4
- **Average: 11 ÷ 4 = 2.75**

**A.2 Health**
- Physical: 1 ← lowest individual score
- Mental: 3
- Spiritual: 2
- **Average: 6 ÷ 3 = 2.0** ← lowest average

**A.3 Relationships** 
- Family: 3, Partner: 4, Friends: 3, Community: 2
- **Average: 12 ÷ 4 = 3.0**

**A.4 Career**
- Finances: 2, Development: 3, Satisfaction: 3  
- **Average: 8 ÷ 3 = 2.67**

**Selected Focus Area: Physical Health** (lowest score in lowest average area)

### 1.2 Problem Assessment (B.2)

Problems in Physical Health:

| Problem | Effort (1-5) | Impact (1-5) | Priority |
|---------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| Poor sleep quality | 4 | 5 | 1.25 |
| No exercise routine | 5 | 4 | 0.8 |
| Irregular meals | 2 | 4 | **2.0** ← Winner |
| Too much caffeine | 2 | 2 | 1.0 |
| Poor posture at work | 3 | 3 | 1.0 |

**Selected Problem: Irregular meals** (highest priority score)

### 1.3 Solution Assessment (B.3)

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Problem: I eat at random times, often skip breakfast, rely on snacks
- Better state: Regular meal times, planned nutrition, stable energy
- Why irregular eating? → No meal planning
- Why no planning? → Don't know what to prep  
- Why don't know? → Never learned meal prep basics

**Solutions Generated:**

| Solution | Effort (1-5) | Impact (1-5) | Priority |
|----------|--------------|--------------|----------|
| Learn meal prep basics | 3 | 4 | 1.33 |
| Set meal time alarms | 1 | 3 | **3.0** |
| Prep groceries on Sunday | 2 | 5 | **2.5** |
| Cook in batches | 3 | 3 | 1.0 |
| Use meal planning app | 1 | 3 | **3.0** |

**80/20 Selection:**
- Total priority: 10.83
- 80% target: 8.66
- **Selected**: Meal alarms (3.0) + App (3.0) + Sunday prep (2.5) = 8.5 ✓

### 1.4 Planning and Implementation Setup (B.4)

**Target:** Eat planned meals at regular times 6 days/week  
**Deadline:** 4 weeks from today

**Execution Plan:**
- Week 1: Download app, set alarms, learn basics, prep first week
- Week 2-4: Weekly meal prep routine, daily alarm follow-through
- Resources: $50/week grocery budget, 2 hours Sunday prep time

**Control System:**
- Daily: Did I eat at alarm times? (Y/N)
- Weekly: Planned meals eaten count (goal: 18/21)
- Checkpoint: Sunday evening reviews

---

## DO (D)

### 2.1 Execute Implementation Plan

**Week 1 Actions:**
- ✅ Downloaded "Mealime" app (Sunday)
- ✅ Set 3 daily meal alarms (7am, 12pm, 6pm)
- ✅ Watched 3 YouTube meal prep videos (Sunday)
- ✅ Planned and prepped 5 breakfasts, 5 lunches (Sunday)
- ✅ Grocery shopped with list ($48 spent)

### 2.2 Document Progress

**Daily Tracking (Week 1):**
- Mon: 3/3 planned meals ✅
- Tue: 2/3 planned meals (missed lunch - meeting)
- Wed: 3/3 planned meals ✅  
- Thu: 3/3 planned meals ✅
- Fri: 2/3 planned meals (dinner out with friends)
- Sat: 1/3 planned meals (weekend chaos)
- Sun: 2/3 planned meals (prep day disruption)

**Week 1 Total: 16/21 meals (76%)**

---

## CHECK (C)

### 3.1 Monitor Progress Indicators

**Week 1 Review:**

| Indicator | Target | Actual | Status |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|
| Meals at alarm times | 18/21 | 16/21 | ⚠️ |
| Sunday prep completion | 100% | 90% | ⚠️ |
| Energy stability (1-5) | 4 | 3 | ⚠️ |

### 3.2 Evaluate Results Against Targets

**What's working:**
- App makes meal planning much easier
- Breakfast routine is solid (7/7 this week)
- Sunday prep saves huge amount of daily time

**Deviations identified:**
- Lunch alarms ignored during meetings (3x)
- Weekend meals still chaotic (low structure)
- Dinner prep takes longer than expected

**Root causes of deviations:**
- Calendar conflicts with meal times
- Weekend meal prep not planned
- Underestimated dinner complexity

---

## ACT (A)

### 4.1 Correct Deviations

**Adjustments for Week 2:**
1. **Meeting conflicts**: Set "soft" lunch alarm 15min earlier to prep
2. **Weekend chaos**: Prep weekend meals on Friday evening  
3. **Dinner complexity**: Choose 3 simple 15-min dinner recipes

**Updated approach:**
- Alarm times: 7am, 11:45am (softer), 6pm
- Friday mini-prep: Weekend breakfast/lunch items
- Dinner rule: If takes >20min, use backup simple meal

### 4.2 Standardize Effective Practices

**What to institutionalize:**
- ✅ Sunday 2-hour meal prep block (non-negotiable)
- ✅ App-based planning (works great for variety)  
- ✅ Breakfast routine (perfect execution)

**Process improvements:**
- Add Friday 30-min weekend prep session
- Create "emergency meal" backup list
- Set calendar blocks for meal prep time

**Next cycle focus:**
Continue with meal regularity (target: 85% success rate) OR
Move to next highest priority: Sleep quality improvement

---

## Results Summary

**Week 1 Achievement:** 76% success rate (target: 85%)  
**Key Learning:** Meal planning works, execution needs refinement  
**Next Steps:** Implement adjustments, track Week 2-4, then reassess

**Methodology Effectiveness:**
- ✅ Systematic selection identified real priority (not obvious choice)
- ✅ Quantitative tracking revealed specific failure patterns
- ✅ 80/20 rule focused effort on highest-impact solutions
- ✅ PDCA cycle structured learning and continuous improvement
