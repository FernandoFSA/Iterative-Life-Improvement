# Iterative Life Improvement

## 1. PLAN (P)

### 1.1 Evaluation of Life Areas
Assess your current situation across all life areas (Appendix A). Use life area assessment methods (Appendix B.1) to systematically identify which sub-area needs attention most.

### 1.2 Problem Selection and Analysis  
Select the most important problem in your chosen sub-area. Use problem assessment methods (Appendix B.2) to understand and prioritize problems systematically.

### 1.3 Solution Assessment and Selection
Analyze your chosen problem to understand root causes and define what "better" looks like. Use solution assessment methods (Appendix B.3) to generate, evaluate, and select the best solutions.

### 1.4 Planning and Implementation Setup
Define targets, deadlines, and create detailed execution plans with control systems. Use planning and execution methods (Appendix B.4) to set goals, break solutions into tasks, identify resources, establish progress indicators, and set checkpoints.

## 2. DO (D)

### 2.1 Execute Implementation Plan
Follow your detailed execution plan from step 1.4. Execute planned tasks in sequence, using identified resources.

### 2.2 Document Progress
Record actions taken, results achieved, and any obstacles encountered. Maintain systematic documentation for review.

## 3. CHECK (C)

### 3.1 Monitor Progress Indicators
Use the control system established in step 1.4 to regularly monitor your progress indicators and checkpoint reviews.

### 3.2 Evaluate Results Against Targets
Compare actual outcomes to the targets and deadlines defined in step 1.3. Identify deviations and assess effectiveness.

## 4. ACT (A)

### 4.1 Correct Deviations
Adjust your approach based on what you learned. Fix what's not working.

### 4.2 Standardize Effective Practices
Document and institutionalize what works well. Prepare for the next PDCA cycle.
