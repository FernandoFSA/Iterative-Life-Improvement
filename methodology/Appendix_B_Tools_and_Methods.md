# Appendix B — Evaluation Tools and Methods

## B.1 Life Area Assessment and Selection
1. **Rate all sub-areas (Appendix A) from 1-4:**
   - 1: Terrible, 2: Bad, 3: Good, 4: Excellent
2. **Calculate the average score for each main life area**
3. **Find the life area with the lowest average score**
4. **Pick the sub-area with the lowest individual score within that area**

## B.2 Problem Assessment and Selection
1. **Identify problems in your chosen sub-area:**
   - What's not working? List all problems, big and small
2. **Rate effort required for each problem (1-5):**
   - 1: Very Easy, 2: Easy, 3: Medium, 4: Hard, 5: Very Hard
3. **Rate potential impact of solving each problem (1-5):**
   - 1: Very Low, 2: Low, 3: Medium, 4: High, 5: Very High  
4. **Calculate impact/effort ratio for each problem:**
   - Impact ÷ Effort = Priority score
5. **Pick the problem with the highest ratio**

## B.3 Solution Assessment and Selection
1. **Understand the gap:**
   - What's the problem? (describe what you see)
   - What would "better." look like?
2. **Find the root cause by asking "Why?" three times:**
   - Why is this happening? (immediate cause)
   - Why is that happening? (deeper cause)  
   - Why is that happening? (root cause)
3. **Generate solutions:**
   - Generate 5 possible solutions to address the root cause
4. **Rate effort required for each solution (1-5):**
   - 1: Very Easy, 2: Easy, 3: Medium, 4: Hard, 5: Very Hard
5. **Rate potential impact of each solution (1-5):**
   - 1: Very Low, 2: Low, 3: Medium, 4: High, 5: Very High
6. **Calculate impact/effort ratio for each solution:**
   - Impact ÷ Effort = Priority score
7. **Select solutions using the 80/20 rule:**
   - Rank solutions by priority score (highest to lowest)
   - Pick solutions that sum to 80% of total priority scores

## B.4 Planning and Execution
1. **Define target and deadline:**
   - What specific outcome do you want from these solutions?
   - By when do you want to achieve it?
2. **Create execution plan:**
   - Break solutions into specific tasks
   - Identify needed resources for each task
   - Sequence tasks (what first, second, etc.)
3. **Establish control system:**
   - Define progress indicators (how will you measure progress?)
   - Set checkpoints (when will you review progress?)
4. **Execute and document:**
   - Take action on planned tasks
   - Document what you do and results achieved
